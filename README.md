# rx-subject
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/rx-subject.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/rx-subject/)

minimal Subject implementation, independent of reactive framework.

a Subject exposes a `sink` Observer, and a `source$` Subscribable.
values pushed into the `sink` Observer are emitted by the `source$` Subscribable.

the `source$` Subscribable is hot and accepts any number of subscribers.

# Credits
* implementation based on createEventHandler from [`recompose`](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose).
* unit tests based on the [Subject test suite](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/spec/Subject-spec.ts) of [`RxJS`](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/).

# API
this module exposes a Subject factory:
```ts
export default function createSubject<T>(): Subject<T>

export interface Subject<T> {
  sink: Observer<T>
  source$: Subscribable<T>
}

export interface Observer<T> {
  next(val: T): void
  error?(error?: any): void
  complete?(): void
}

export interface Subscribable<T> {
  subscribe(observer: Observer<T>): Subscription;
  subscribe(
    next: (val: T) => void,
    error?: (error?: any) => void,
    complete?: () => void
  ): Subscription
}

export interface Subscription {
  unsubscribe(): void
}
```

for a detailed specification of this API,
run the [unit tests](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/rx-subject/v3.0.2/spec/web/index.html)
in your browser.
these unit tests are a subset of the [RxJS Subject test suite](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/spec/Subject-spec.ts).

# `Symbol.observable`
This module expects `Symbol.observable` to be defined in the global scope.
Use a polyfill such as [`symbol-observable`](https://npmjs.com/package/symbol-observable/)
and if necessary a `Symbol` polyfill.
Check the [`symbol-observable-polyfill` script](./package.json#L10)
for an example of how to generate the standalone polyfill,
which can than be [loaded from a script tag](./spec/web/index.html#L26),
or simply add `import 'symbol-observable'` at the top of your project's main file.

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
